# Dealing with lists and navigating... (part 1)

How difficult can it be to display a list of items on the screen and navigate to a detail version of it?

The idea with this exercise is:

- Understanding how a `ListView` of sorts works in react-native.
- Give a quick look at navigation and argument passing between screens.
- Try a new way of organising my code, styles and components.
- Give it a try to flexbox and how it interacts between different components.

A list of things to do would be an interesting way of testing this as:

1. The app should display a list of items to accomplish.
1. Remove those items once done (triggering a state change of sorts).
1. Provide a way to customise the content of the items.
